# This is a test page

## You can use markdown if you'd so like

We're just gonna use some basic markdown syntax, this shit is what I will use for my blog, woooo!

Everybody needs a friend. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Do an almighty painting with us. `window.onload = function()` All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let that brush dance around there and play. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Every time you practice, you learn more.



```javascript
var div;
window.onload = function() {
  div = document.getElementById('myDivElement');
  div.circularReference = div;
  div.lotsOfData = new Array(10000).join('*');
};
```

## Sub Headline Here

Really, I'm just hoping that this looks alright. I'm thinking that the text should scale with the size of the display, but I'm just not sure how I am feeling yet. I guess I will just try and feel things out and see where I wind up.
