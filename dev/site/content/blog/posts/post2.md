# Post #2

We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. In this world, everything can be happy. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.

> Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You are only limited by your imagination. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone.


Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

> The light is your friend. Preserve it. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

Every time you practice, you learn more. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

## Header Level 2
Little short strokes. And just raise cain. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Just use the old one inch brush. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

### Header Level 3

Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. You can do anything your heart can imagine. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.

```javascript
class Picture {
  constructor(width, height, pixels) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.pixels = pixels;
  }
  static empty(width, height, color) {
    let pixels = new Array(width * height).fill(color);
    return new Picture(width, height, pixels);
  }
  pixel(x, y) {
    return this.pixels[x + y * this.width];
  }
  draw(pixels) {
    let copy = this.pixels.slice();
    for (let {x, y, color} of pixels) {
      copy[x + y * this.width] = color;
    }
    return new Picture(this.width, this.height, copy);
  }
}
```

See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Just beat the devil out of it. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We have a fantastic little sky! For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. The light is your friend. Preserve it.

Let's get crazy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.

Here's another little happy bush We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. There it is. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You are only limited by your imagination. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone.

Every day I learn. This painting comes right out of your heart. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. You need the dark in order to show the light. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.

There we go. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?
